# SQL Queries

In the SQLqueries.ipynb file located in the notebooks folder, Luis, Marco's son, utilizes the public board games database to comprehend client preferences and assist a client in discovering the ideal board game.

Towards the end, he begins pondering questions such as which video games are the best-selling. Following several queries, he opts to delve into visualizing the data to draw additional conclusions.


# Tableau analysis and results

To better communicate the results of his findings to the rest of the family, Luis creates a Tableau story containing several dashboards featuring compelling insights into future video game releases. It is possible to explore the Tableau story [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/patricia.zapata.blanco/viz/VideoGamesanalysis_17005247117480/Letsplay).
